Very quick manual:

For all tools, you can get help for the command line options using -h: 
python tool.py -h
or (in case of chmod +x)
./tool.py -h


spector.py has a (very preliminary) interface using the keyboard and mouse:

* keys "," and "."      decrease/increase fft length

* keys "[" and "]"      decreas/increase number of averages

numbers (see state=XX in the plot title)
* the "0" key           switch all mouse commands off, useful when you want to zoom/pan
 
for the next 3, left click adds a point, right click removes nearest point
* the "1" key           used for drawing a line by hand, not used yet

* the "2" key           used to define the line for the minimum frequency of the search range 

* the "3" key           used to define the line for the maximum frequency of the search range

* the "9" key           used for masking out segments (e.g. an unlock), need to left-click twice at both edges of the segment. right clicking on a segment removes it  

* the "d" key           when in mode 1/2/3: remove all points of the current line

* the "m" key           find bin with the maximum psd for every frequency bin between min and max lines. pressing again removes the points

* the "M" key           save frequency of maximum points to file spectool_freq.h5

* the "b" key           calculate the BRMS between min and max lines. pressing again removes the BRMS plot

* the "B" key           save BRMS to file spectool_brms.h5

* the "H" key           reset color axis


Apart from this, there are the standard matplotlib keyboard shortcuts. Some of the most useful:

* the "o" key           toggle zoom cursor on/off, after this you can drag a rectangle to zoom in
    
* the "p" key           toggle pan/drag cursor on/off, to move plot around
(it is best to set the mouse mode to "0" before using the above two)

* the "x" key           pressing this while zooming/panning will restrict them to the x-axis           

* the "y" key           pressing this while zooming/panning will restrict them to the y-axis
